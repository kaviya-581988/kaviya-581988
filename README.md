Data Science Graduate Student | Telecom Analytics Professional | Teaching Assistant

I’m a Data Science graduate student with 7 years of experience in large‑scale telecom network operations. I specialize in Python‑based data analysis, exploratory data analysis, applied statistics, and building insights from real‑world noisy datasets. Currently working as a Teaching Assistant for C Programming, Data Structures, and Network Defense at the University of Houston–Clear Lake.

I’m actively seeking Data Science, Analytics, and Machine Learning internship opportunities.
